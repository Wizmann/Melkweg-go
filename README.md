## Some Rules

This project is now under developing. Feel free to come up with any issues if you find some.

I'm use "Google C++ coding style" as the rule of code style for this project. I don't it's wierd, but please don't judge me for that.

You can come up PR with any code style you like, I'll fix the style thing later.
